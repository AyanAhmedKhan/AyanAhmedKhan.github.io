                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>This Virtual Lab is part of the <b>Electronic Lab project</b> , created as a part of the academic
                    curriculum at <b>MITS Gwalior</b>. The lab focuses on providing a platform for hands-on virtual
                    experiments in the field of electronics and Internet of things. Through this project, we aim to make
                    theoretical concepts more accessible by allowing students to interact with simulations in real-time.

                <h3>Our Mentor</h3>
                <p>The project is guided by our esteemed teacher, <strong>Namita Arya Ma'am</strong>, who has provided
                    invaluable support and insights. Under her mentorship, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and
                    practice, ensuring that students gain a deeper understanding of core principles through interactive
                    learning.</p>

                <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project is to provide an engaging, accessible, and comprehensive learning
                    environment that helps students at <b>MITS Gwalior</b> and beyond, understand and apply the concepts
                    of electronics and circuit theory with ease.</p>
